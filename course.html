    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        During my engineering courses, I have to do projects that I find very interesting, for example we made algorithms to could apply to image compression and we needed to optimise them as much as possible which was very exciting. We also made games which you can find on my github and we are currently working in big groups (of 7) to developp an application, a particular simulator for us, and it really help to imporve our communication, organisation and all of these soft skills that we do not pratice that often. I am personally very involve in the organisation, we did pratice "agile methods" which are new way of organising a group, especially in a company, where teams are consider as seperate entities and the manager cannot intervene that much into the process : teams are more free but it needs a much better organisation beforehand. You may find below a picture of the UI that we currently have for this project. It is not much but we are not even half way through and later on, we will have a menu for example.
