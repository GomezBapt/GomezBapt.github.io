    Thanks to the ENSEEIHT, I was able to join INGE+ in order to help young student achieve their goals by tutoring them. I have started on October and since then, I've learned so many things, been able to participate to conference and i don't regret my choice. I have discover new skills at teaching which I didn't expected to have and it has led me to give lessons to student in highschool in Mathematics. While teaching them English and helping them improve, I can pratice my English and learn new vocabulary.

      I have been encouraged to take the Sulitest by my teachers : it's been a great test to evaluate my sustainability knowledges. I have also learned vocabulary specific to sustainability and technical rules and laws about sustainability which helps me to better understand the situation and what is currently done to improve the current state of our planet. You can see my results below (in French).
